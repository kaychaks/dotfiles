# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about
# ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated
# by your text editor or operating system, you probably
# want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#
# NOTE! Please use 'git ls-files -i --exclude-standard'
# command after changing this file, to see if there are
# any tracked files which get ignored after the change.
